; This claims that a is on a square adjacent to b, 
; but it is false since there is a square in between. ~SameRow(e, d) SameCol(a, f) ~SameRow(a, b)Between(a, d, f) ~ ~Larger(f, e)
; Two negation signs in a row cancel each other out, 
; so this claims that f is larger than e. ~ ~LeftOf(a, a) ~ ~ ~Cube(c)
; Three negation signs in a row are equivalent to 
; one, so this sentence is equivalent to the claim 
; that c is not a cube. This is true in Boole's World, 
; since c is a tet. ~ ~ ~Tet(c)s=82838;
