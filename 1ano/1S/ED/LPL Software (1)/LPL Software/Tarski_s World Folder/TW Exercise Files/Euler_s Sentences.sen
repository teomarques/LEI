; So at least one of a, b, and c is a Tet.  Reason by 
; cases using the next three sentences to figure out
; the shapes of the three blocks.Tet(a) $ (Tet(b) & Tet(c))Tet(b) $ (Cube(a) & Tet(c))Tet(c) $ (Cube(a) & Dodec(b))Larger(a, b) % Larger(b, c)Larger(c, b) % Larger(b, a)SameSize(a, c)
; Use this with 5 and 6 to determine the relative 
; sizes of a, b, and c.Small(a) $ Medium(b)
; Using 8 and 9 you can now figure out their absolute 
; sizes.Medium(a) $ Small(b)s=82391;
